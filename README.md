# Python script for Sensirion SPS30
Python script to save data from Sensirion SPS30 particulate matter sensor.

This is an adaptation of Szymon Jakubiak's script to support MicroPython, plus support for additional commands. I am testing on a RP2040.

This is not complete and definitely not polished.
